    .SYNOPSIS

    This function tests pre-requists for migrating directly to a Office 365 Unified Group.

    .DESCRIPTION

    This function tests pre-requists for migrating directly to a Office 365 Unified Group.

    .PARAMETER exchangeDLMembership

    The members of the distribution group.

    .PARAMETER exchangeBypassModerationSMTP

    All users with bypass moderation rights that cannot be mirrored in the service.

    .PARAMETER allObjectsSendAsNormalized

    All objects with send as rights that cannot be mirrored in the service.

    .PARAMETER allOffice365ManagedBy

    All groups that have the list as a manager.

    .PARAMETER allOffice365SendAsAccess

    All groups in Office 365 that this group has send as rights on.

    .PARAMETER allOffice365FullMailboxAccess

    All objects in Office 365 the migrated group has full mailbox access on.

    .PARAMETER allOffice365MailboxFolderPermissions

    All objects in Office 365 the migrated group has mailbox folder permissions on.

    .PARAMETER addManagersAsMembers

    Specifies if managers will be added as members - since owners must be members of a unified group.

    .OUTPUTS

    None
