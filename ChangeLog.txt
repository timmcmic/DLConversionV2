Created function restore-MigratedDistributionList

This function takes the originalDLConfigurationADXML and imports the settings.  A restoration of the group based on this data is then performed.

If the group mail address is found (most likely the dynamic DL) the administrator is prompted to remove it.  (Mandatory)

If the group mail address-migratedBySCript is found the administrator is prompted to remove it.  (Optional)

If the renamed group with ! is found by searching for object GUID then a restoration of attributes is performed to this object.

If the renamed group via objectGUID is not found then an entirely new group is created.

Graph is utilized to delete the group based on group SID from Entra ID.   This allows ad connect to soft match the restored group.

NOTE:  This restores the group to it's state at the time of migration and will result in rolling back any changes in Office 365.

Issue #164 - addresed in build 2.9.8.33
4/15/2024

Customer migrating from machine that is Azure AD Joined and not a member of the domain.

Multiple ad calls failing.

Discovered that all AD functions were not implementing the auth type specified in the DL migration command.

Updated the acceptable types from Basic,Kerberos to Basic,Negotiate.  Using negotiate allows NTML or Kerberos.

Updated all functions that utilize AD commands to include the parameter $activeDirectoryAuthenticationMethod.

Updated all function calls to pass the method.

Default is negotiate.
