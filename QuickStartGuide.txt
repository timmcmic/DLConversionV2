DLConversionV2 QuickStart Guide
======================================================================

If you have accessed this quick start guide you have discovered and installed the DLConversionV2 Powershell Module. 
Congratulations!

The purpose of this guide is to assist in getting started as quickly as possible migrating your distribution lists to Office 365.

*********************

Step 0:  Ensure all dependent powershell modules are updated.

By default installing the module installs the minimum requirements for the module to run.  It is possible that these are out of date already.

Open powershell as administrator
Run:  Get-Module Microsoft.Graph* | update-module -force
Run:  Update-Module ExchangeOnline

*********************

Step 1:  Identify how Office 365 resources will be accessed.

When performing single migrations the module supports interactive authentication to Office 365 resources <or> certificate authentication to application registrations.
When performing multiple migrations the module REQUIRES certificate authentication to Office 365.
Certificate authentication is required for Microsoft Graph and Exchange Online.

ProTip:  Setting up certificate authentication streamlines this process and is recommended.

Establishing Certificate Authentication for Exchange Online

ProTip:  The same EntraID application registration can be utilized for both Exchange Online and Microsoft Graph if the permissions are applied to the same app registration.

If certificate authentication is configured record the certificate thumbprint and the application registration ID.  This will be required for later commands.

*********************

Step 2:  Identity the EntraID tenant ID that will be required to execute commands.

*********************

Step 3:  Identity the onmicrosoft.com domain associated with your Exchange Online organization.

This step is only required if utilizing certificate authentication for Exchange Online.

Log into the Entra portal.
Select EntraID
Under EntraID select custom domains.
The something.onmicrosoft.com domain will be listed.  This is the domain required to proceed.

*********************

Step 4:  Identify other accounts required to run the powershell module.

A)  Active Directory:
    *Domain Administrator:  If all groups and resources reside in the same domain in the Active Directory forest.
    *Enterprise Administrator:  If groups and members reside in multiple domains in the Active Directory forest.
    *Note:  The module is not tested with any other Active Directory permissions.
B)  EntraID Connect:
    *The account specified must be a local administrator on the EntraID Connect server.
    *In many cases this is the same account utilized for Active Directory connectivity in Step 4A.
C)  Exchange Online  (Optional):
    *This account must be an Exchange Organization Administrator.
    *This is not required if certificate authentication is utilized.
D)  Microsoft Graph  (Optional):
    *This account will be utilized to connect to Microsoft Graph.
    *The account will be assigned the scopes at minimum User.Read.All and Group.Read.All.

*********************

Step 5:  Test the MS Graph connection to ensure that the scopes are properly assigned.

A)  Certificate Authentication
    *Connect-MGGraph -scopes "User.Read.All,Group.Read.All" -TenantId "TenantId" -AppId "AppID" -CertificateThumbprint "ThumbPrint"
    *If the scopes required are not present the administrator is prompted to approve the scopes or request approval.
B)  User Authentication
    *Connect-MGGraph -scopes "User.Read.All,Group.Read.All" -TenantID "TenantID"
    *If the scopes required are not present the administrator is prompted to approve the scopes or request approval.
