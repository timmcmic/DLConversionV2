Function start-MultipleTestPreMigrations
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS

    This is the wrapper function that provisions jobs for multiple distribution list migrations.

    .DESCRIPTION

    This is the wrapper function that provisions jobs for multiple distribution list migrations.

    .PARAMETER groupSMTPAddresses

    *REQUIRED*
    This is the array of distribution lists to be migrated 

    .PARAMETER globalCatalogServer

    *REQUIRED*
    A global catalog server in the domain where the group to be migrated resides.


    .PARAMETER activeDirectoryCredential

    *REQUIRED*
    This is the credential that will be utilized to perform operations against the global catalog server.
    If the group and all it's dependencies reside in a single domain - a domain administrator is acceptable.
    If the group and it's dependencies span multiple domains in a forest - enterprise administrator is required.
      
    .PARAMETER logFolder

    *REQUIRED*
    The location where logging for the migration should occur including all XML outputs for backups.

    .PARAMETER aadConnectServer

    *OPTIONAL*
    This is the AADConnect server that automated sycn attempts will be attempted.
    If specified with an AADConnect credential - delta syncs will be triggered automatically in attempts to service the move.
    This requires WINRM be enabled on the ADConnect server and may have additional WINRM dependencies / configuration.
    Name should be specified in fully qualified domain format.

    .PARAMETER aadConnectCredential

    *OPTIONAL*
    The credential specified to perform remote powershell / winrm sessions to the AADConnect server.

    .PARAMETER exchangeServer

    *REQUIRED IF HYBRID MAIL FLOW ENALBED*
    This is the on-premises Exchange server that is required for enabling hybrid mail flow if the option is specified.
    If using a load balanced namespace - basic authentication on powershell must be enabled on all powersell virtual directories.
    If using a single server (direct connection) then kerberos authentication may be utilized.
    
    .PARAMETER exchangeCredential

    *REQUIRED IF HYBRID MAIL FLOW ENABLED*
    This is the credential utilized to establish remote powershell sessions to Exchange on-premises.
    This acccount requires Exchange Organization Management rights in order to enable hybrid mail flow.

    .PARAMETER exchangeOnlineCredential

    *REQUIRED IF NO OTHER CREDENTIALS SPECIFIED*
    This is the credential utilized for Exchange Online connections.  
    The credential must be specified if certificate based authentication is not configured.
    The account requires global administration rights / exchange organization management rights.
    An exchange online credential cannot be combined with an exchangeOnlineCertificateThumbprint.

    .PARAMETER exchangeOnlineCertificateThumbprint

    *REQUIRED IF NO OTHER CREDENTIALS SPECIFIED*
    This is the certificate thumbprint that will be utilzied for certificate authentication to Exchange Online.
    This requires all the pre-requists be established and configured prior to access.
    A certificate thumbprint cannot be specified with exchange online credentials.

    .PARAMETER exchangeAuthenticationMethod

    *OPTIONAL*
    This allows the administrator to specify either Kerberos or Basic authentication for on premises Exchange Powershell.
    Basic is the assumed default and requires basic authentication be enabled on the powershell virtual directory of the specified exchange server.

    .PARAMETER retainOffice365Settings

    *OPTIONAL*
    It is possible over the course of migrations that cloud only resources could have dependencies on objects that still remain on premises.
    The administrator can choose to scan office 365 to capture any cloud only dependencies that may exist.
    The default is true.

    .PARAMETER doNoSyncOU

    *REQUIRED IF RETAIN GROUP FALSE*
    This is the administrator specified organizational unit that is NOT configured to sync in AD Connect.
    When the administrator specifies to NOT retain the group the group is moved to this OU to allow for deletion from Office 365.
    A doNOSyncOU must be specified if the administrator specifies to NOT retain the group.

    .PARAMETER retainOriginalGroup

    *OPTIONAL*
    Allows the administrator to retain the group - for example if the group also has on premises security dependencies.
    This triggers a mail disable of the group resulting in group deletion from Office 365.
    The name of the group is randomized with a character ! to ensure no conflict with hybird mail flow - if hybrid mail flow enabled.

    .PARAMETER enableHybridMailFlow

    *OPTIONAL*
    Allows the administrator to decide that they want mail flow from on premises to cloud to work for the migrated DL.
    This involves provisioning a mail contact and a dynamic distribution group.
    The dynamic distribution group is intentionally choosen to prevent soft matching of a group and an undo of the migration.
    This option requires on premises Exchange be specified and configured.

    .PARAMETER groupTypeOverride

    *OPTIONAL*
    This allows the administrator to override the group type created in the cloud from on premises.
    For example - if the group was provisioned on premises as security but does not require security rights in Office 365 - the administrator can override to DISTRIBUTION.
    Mandatory types -> SECURITY or DISTRIBUTION

	.OUTPUTS

    Logs all activities and backs up all original data to the log folder directory.
    Moves the distribution group from on premieses source of authority to office 365 source of authority.
