    .DESCRIPTION

    This function extracts the send as ACLs of the group to be migrated.

    .PARAMETER adGlobalCatalogPowershellSessionName

    The powershell session to invoke the get-ACL call remotely - ensures we use the specified DC.

    .PARAMETER globalCatalogServer

    The global catalog server to feed into the normalization command.

    .PARAMETER DN

    The DN of the object to pass to normalize.

    .PARAMETER adCredential

    The credential for the AD get operations.

    .OUTPUTS

    This returns the normalized list of SMTP addresses assigned send as permissions.

    .EXAMPLE

    get-GroupSendAsPermissions -DN DN -globalCatalog GC
